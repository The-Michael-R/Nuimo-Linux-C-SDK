	* nuimo.c (nuimo_init_bt):
	Added: Return EXIT_FAILURE if no BT-Adapter was found.
	Changed: Moved get_characteristics() in own loop to make sure the order of items in ob_list does not matter

	* nuimo.c (cb_change_val_notify):
	Changed: Improved rotation handling. Hopefully this is working under 64Bit


2016-10-03 The-Michael-R <The-Michael-R@users.noreply.github.com>
	* Makefile:
	Added: -g to the debug switches

	* nuimo.c:
	Changed: uint to unsigned int

	* nuimo.c (connect_nuimo):
	Fixed: Wrong test for present BT_ADAPTER and moved it to an earlier to optimize performance
	Fixed: Set freed pointer to NULL
	Changed: Replaced malloc/setmem/strncpy by strdup

	* nuimo.c (get_characteristics):
	Changed: Replaced malloc/setmem/strncpy by strdup

	* nuimo.c (cb_object_removed):
	Fixed: Wrong test for present BT_ADAPTER and moved it to an earlier to optimize performance

	* nuimo.c (nuimo_print_status):
	Fixed: If no [NUIMO].path is present, skip next printf section
	Added: Print of Nuimp path

	* nuimo.c (nuimo_read_value):
	Fixed: Missing initialisation of inters and values. Caused problems because the coded tested for NULL pointers.

	* nuimo.c (nuimo_init_bt):
	Changed: Call of get_characteristics() only if NUIMO.proxy is set


2016-09-26 The-Michael-R <The-Michael-R@users.noreply.github.com>
	* nuimo.h:
	Changed: Definition of actions from #define to enum added and added *_LEN to identify the number of entries


2016-09-26 The-Michael-R <The-Michael-R@users.noreply.github.com>
	* nuimo.h:
	Removed: FLY_BACKWARD and FLY_THORWARD not supported anymore

	* nuimo.c (cb_change_val_notify):
	Removed: Accidently a debug printf was still in the code.

	* example.c (my_cb_function):
	Removed: FLY_BACKWARD and FLY_THORWARD not supported anymore

2016-09-18 The-Michael-R <The-Michael-R@users.noreply.github.com>
	* General:
	Modified the comments to use doxygen for documentation.
	Added more text for documentation.

	* nuimo.h:
	Added new #defines for added Nuimo functionality (TOUCH_LEFT, _RIGHT, _TOP, _BOTTOM)
	Changed return value from int to void for nuimo_init_cb_function

	* nuimo.c (nuimo_init_cb_function):
	Changed return value from int to void
	Added missing DEBUG_PRINT

	* example.c (my_cb_function):
	Using the new function to generate bitmap
	Added examples for new Nuimo functionality

	* example (bmp_to_array);
	New: Function to translate string-bitmap to  array for LED-Matrix

	* Makefile:
	Added doc-target. Generating documentation using doxygen


2016-09-17 The-Michael-R <The-Michael-R@users.noreply.github.com>
	* nuimo.c (nuimo_init_bt):
	returned EXIT_SUCCESS in case of error in BT-Communication; now it is now EXIT_FAILURE

	* nuimo.c :
	Added prototypes of priveate functions
	Changed structure to hold the object-removed event handler
	Changed my_nuimo->connected to my_nuimo.>characteristic[NUIMO].connected
	New my_nuimo->active_discovery (TRUE after StartDiscovery; FALSE after StopDiscovery)

	* nuimo.c (cb_object_removed):
	Added to cover disapearing Nuimo. And start looking again

	* nuimo.h :
	Moved #define DEBUG into Makefile

	* example.c (cb_termination);
	Changed cb_termination to match required format (return boolean)

	* example.c (main):
	Moved nuimo_read_value(NUIMO_BATTERY) to SWIPE_DOWN action to reduce traffic

	* example.h:
	Added #include <glib-unix.h> to prevent implicit declaration
	Removed cb_termination prototype (is a private function

	* Makefile :
	Added debug-target; It builds the example with debug printing enabled
